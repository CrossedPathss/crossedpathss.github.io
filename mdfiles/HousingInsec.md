Previously, Pierce hasn’t had very clear access to getting help with housing information beyond international students and when looking for help with grants to pay for emergencies, the information is buried deeply within the Financial Aid page. 

With this resource we want to be able to bring this information to your fingertips and end the hunt for getting assistance. 



## You're not Alone

Information on housing insecurity within the community and the broader world.  It’s not uncommon that students in college face housing insecurity, with the price associated with going to school it can be hard to even get started. Even when you have started school, personal things in your life can come up and hinder you from success. One day you have a house and the next you are getting an eviction notice or choosing between eating and keeping a roof over your head. 

Many college students struggle to find adequate, affordable housing options near their campus, and more than 56,00 college students indicated they were homeless on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in 2013. 

One college has even simulated housing insecurity by having students experience what it would be like to be homeless. This simulation is to help students understand the issue and help them empathize for those people. [Here](https://www.radford.edu/content/radfordcore/home/news/releases/2017/december/housing-insecurity-simulation.html) is the full article to learn more. 



## Pierce Has Helped Before

In March of 2018, I received an 11-day notice to vacate from my apartment. This is the first apartment I had rented completely on my own after a divorce, and I had been living there for four years. I approached my boss about my situation. I was employed (work-study) by Pierce College at the time. My boss is the one who printed me an application for the Pierce College foundation emergency grant. This is a general grant, not intended only for housing but it also covers housing. Some details are different for each person’s situation. My situation was time-sensitive. 

 The application is a couple of pages long, and covers details, and is reviewed by the Financial Aid Department. This is to the best of my understanding.

Along with filling out the application, I provided the original documentation – the 11-day notice from my apartment. I did go and look to other apartments to move as soon as possible. There were two apartments I found, and applied to and communicated the status of what happened with financial aid. I ended up getting financial assistance with the deposit moving into a new apartment. 



### *What is an Emergency Assistance Grant?*

* Directly from Pierce College’s website, “We offer several grants to Washington Resident Students with extenuating circumstances. Please contact the Financial Aid Office to learn more about these grants.”

* Some uses for the grant include bus ticket, childcare stipend, food, gas card, housing, textbook funds, travel, tuition assistance, and utilities. There is a process to getting this type of grant which includes an initial application, foundation approval, fiscal services, and student notification. 

* Instructors at Pierce should be informed on this information which makes it easier if you are more comfortable with an instructor rather than a Financial aid worker. Currently, you aren’t able to download the application for yourself off of Pierce’s website so it’s best to inform an instructor of your situation so they can help you with the formal application.
