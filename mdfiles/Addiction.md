 #  Student’s Guide to Combating Addiction 

# INTRODUCTION 

Alcohol and drug addiction has been a problem amongst not only whole communities, but amongst students. Here at Pierce College, we want to make it clear that we stand by all of out students affected and we are here to help. These problems can be mitigated through harm reduction. This document is a resource intended to help people affected by addiction  -- by giving them the tools to overcome obstacles in their personal lives through easily accessible community resources.  If you or someone you know is affected by addiction, you are in the right place. You are not alone.  

Pierce college is not out to hinder people in the endeavors. Pierce college believes that it is imperative to help both students and faculty succeed by giving students the tools necessary to get back on their feet and creature bright futures they can be proud of.  

# How School Is Affected

Students will sometimes turn to drugs for social acceptance or even anxiety from stress. The consequences became apparent when the student misses school due to hangovers and their grades start to plummet.

# Pierce Policies

While the goal of this guide is to help those with substance abuse problems, we must make it clear that in no way does Pierce College condone the use of psychoactive drug use, as it is federally illegal to use controlled substances and you will likely be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law if you choose to engage in such behaviors. However, if you choose to do so, we are not here to judge you and we are here to help. It is important to know what Pierce College’s policy related to drugs and alcohol on campus are if you are a user. The Pierce College policy is somewhat vague, as it states that alcohol and illegal drugs, including marijuana, are prohibited on all places on campus. Anybody who makes the choice to break this rule will be subject to any disciplinary sanctions, which range from a verbal warning to dismissal from the college. If you are interested in reading more, [here](https://www.pierce.ctc.edu/safety-substances) is what Campus Safety has to say about their policy on controlled substances on campus.

Tacoma-Pierce County Medical-Assisted Opioid Treatment

​	This form of treatment specifically applies to those who are addicted to opiates such as Heroin and prescription painkillers such as Oxycodone and Percocet. Medical-Assisted treatment involves use of the the opioid agonist Methadone, which helps addicts by diminishing the severe symptoms of opiate withdrawal.

They also offer continuing outpatient treatment on satellite campuses all over Washington state, including Puyallup and Tacoma locations.

# Harm Reduction

​	Psychoactive substances have been around for thousands of years and have exploded in popularity in the past 200 years. National governments have made efforts to reduce the amount of drug users globally, yet rates of drug use are only going up. It is time for society to accept that we can not get rid of illegal drugs entirely, and all we can do is try to help those who make those choices do safely. At the end of the day, the important thing is that people aren’t dying from drug use, as addiction is a medical disease that society needs to do better about treating as such. 

What is Harm Reduction? 

NOTE: None of these harm reduction practices are available or endorsed by Pierce College, the purpose of this section is to educate drug users about the benefits of harm reduction and how they can practice it in their own lives outside of school.

​	As defined by the Harm Reduction Coalition, Harm reduction is a set of practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing negative consequences associated with drug use. Harm Reduction is also a movement for social justice built on a belief in, and respect for, the rights of people who use drugs.  In a sense, harm reduction is more focused on reducing drug-related harm than reducing drug use. Some examples include but are not limited to:

- Needle Exchange programs for IV drug users, reducing the spread of diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. 
-  Access to affordable of free Naloxone kits, which can reverse the effects of an overdose instantly, saving lives. 
- Legalizing drug testing kits for all drugs, so users can now exactly what is in the substance they’re taking, drastically reducing overdose deaths. 
- Consumption centers with medical professionals on standby who can be there to prevent overdoses if need be.
